1. Startup Name
Startup Name:  MjiRide

2. Origin Story
Our Story:
The idea originates from the everyday struggles faced by commuters in our public transportation system—marked by disorganization, reckless driving, unroadworthy vehicles, and unreliable stops. 
Witnessing these persistent issues firsthand inspired Garvin Aguko and Kyle Aluma to come up with a practical solution: a structured carpooling service designed to offer a safer, more efficient, and more reliable alternative. Sparked by personal experiences and a desire to improve the daily lives of many, the idea aims to eliminate the chaos of traditional commuting. It matters deeply to our community because better transportation means safer roads, reduced stress, and a stronger sense of trust and connection among commuters.
